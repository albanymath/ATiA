ABSTRACT: "This paper considers three aspects of the inverse problem between merge trees and barcodes in persistent homology.
Much of our investigation leverages a recently discovered connection between barcodes in general position and the symmetric group: death order is the permutation of birth order. The first important outcome of our study is a clearer combinatorial distinction between the space of phylogenetic trees (as defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann) and the space of merge trees. Generic BHV trees on $n$ leaf nodes fall into $(2n-3)!!$ distinct strata, but the analogous number for merge trees is counted by maximal chains in the lattice of partitions, i.e. $(n+1)!n!2^{-n}$. We then go on to provide a complete characterization of the distribution of tree realization numbers---assuming a uniform distribution on the symmetric group---in terms of a Dirichlet convolution operation. This provides a type of null hypothesis, which appears to be different from the distributions observed in neuron data. Finally, we take up this null hypothesis to study the distribution of structural averages (or 1-centers) of merge trees that arise as the inverse image of barcodes. We calculate the expected number of corollas in the corolla decomposition of the averaged merge tree and bound the variance, which leads us to believe that the ``stickiness phenomena'' observed for BHV space occurs for merge tree space as well."
