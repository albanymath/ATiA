\begin{abstract}
Cellular sheaves have constituted an extremely successful program in the applied topology community. In this talk, I will report recent efforts to apply the principles of cellular sheaf theory and sheaf laplacians to multi-agent systems, particularly from the angle of modal logic. Along the way, I will define several Laplacians which act as diffusion operators on lattice-valued network sheaves.
