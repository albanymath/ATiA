\begin{abstract}
The decomposition of persistence modules into simple parts or ``bars'' is basic to topological data analysis. However, such breakdowns exist only for persistence modules derived from homology with field coefficients. This leaves a structural gap between persistence and the wider field of homological algebra. Recently, Patel narrowed the gap by defining barcodes for tame persistence modules in categories outside Vect. In a departure from the linear regime, however, such barcodes do not accompany an algebraic decomposition of the module itself---there is no notion of a ``cycle representative'' for one of these bars. We present the missing link: a new decomposition scheme that extends the notion of ``factorization into bars'' from the linear regime to any abelian category (as well as many non-abelian categories). Time permitting, we will discuss applications in theory, computation, and visualization.
