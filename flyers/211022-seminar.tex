\begin{abstract}
Given a smooth map from a manifold to the plane, and some poset structure on the plane, one can take the pre-images of the planar subsets to get a poset structure on the manifold.  In this talk I will outline how one can compute the homotopy-type of the poset structure (provided the poset on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is smooth-enough) in terms of cellular attachments.  In the case of the bi-filtration of the plane by ``quadrants'' $(-\infty,a] \times (-\infty,b]$ this gives us a description of the homotopy-type of the bi-filtration of the manifold, analogous to classical Morse theory.
