\begin{abstract}
In this talk I will present a sheaf-theoretic construction of shape space---the space of all shapes. We do this by describing a sheaf on the poset category of o-minimal sets, where objects of this category are mapped to their Persistent Homology Transforms (PHTs). A recent result that builds on work of Schapira, showed that this transform is injective, thus making the PHT a good summary object for each shape. Our sheaf result allows us to ``glue'' PHTs of different shapes together to build up the PHT of a larger shape. Furthermore, by a new approximation result I will show that degree 0 information, i.e.~$\text{PHT}^0$, is sufficient to compute $\text{PHT}^n$ for any $n$ up to some tolerance. 

This is joint work with Justin Curry and Sayan Mukherjee.
