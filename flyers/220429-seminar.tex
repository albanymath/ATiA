\begin{abstract}
In recent work with M. Lesnick and M. Bender we formulate an algorithm for computing multiparameter persistence modules and their minimal presentations using results from computational algebra and Gr\"obner basis theory. In this talk I will highlight interesting connections between Gr\"obner basis theory and topological data analysis from a computational perspective.
